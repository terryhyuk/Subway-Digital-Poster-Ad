## My Contributions

- Designed a user-friendly registration page with input validation
- Implemented ID duplication check and email format validation
- Added password validation logic with success/error popups
- Analyzed subway station data to optimize advertisement targeting  
  > *Note: No significant patterns were found in the data, so the analysis was not reflected in the final app, but the full analysis process is included for reference.*

## How to Run

### iOS App

1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/terryhyuk/Subway-Digital-Poster-Ad`
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Install dependencies using CocoaPods (if needed)
4. Run the app on a simulator or a physical device

### Backend (FastAPI)

1. Go to the `Python_Server` directory:  
   `cd Python_Server`
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:  
   `python3 -m venv venv`  
   `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies (requirements.txt is in the project root):  
   `pip install -r ../requirements.txt`
4. Run the FastAPI server:  
   `uvicorn ad_subway:app --reload`

- The server will start at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
- Interactive API docs available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
